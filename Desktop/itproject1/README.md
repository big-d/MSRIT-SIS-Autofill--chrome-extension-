This is a chrome extension under construction:

Objective: Create an easier way for the faculty at MSRIT to enter the student's internal marks assessment details into the Student Information System (SIS) , the user has to select a text file which contains the internal assessment marks of all the students, the extension has to autofill all the text fields in the webpage using that data.


The above is an work in progress.
